This package contains a precompiled binary version of the GraphQL
compiler (gqlc). This binary is intended for users who want to use GraphQL
in any language and do not want to compile gqlc themselves. To install, simply
place this binary somewhere in your PATH.

If you intend to use the included well known types then don't forget to
copy the contents of the 'include' directory somewhere as well, for example
into '/usr/local/include/'.

Please refer to our official github site for more installation instructions:
