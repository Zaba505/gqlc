# GraphQL Schema Language

The documents in this directory contain a specification
for a slightly extended "GraphQL Schema Language" than originally defined on https://graphql.org/learn/schema.

Namely, the addition of comments in schema definition files and
the ability to import other schema files.

## File Type

All GraphQL Schema Language files use the file extension `.gql` or `.graphql`.
