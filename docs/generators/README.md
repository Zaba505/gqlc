# Generators

The hearts of `gqlc` is the generators, both built-in and community maintained.
Generators are specified at the command line with the format: `--name_out`.

When specifying a generator you can pass it options either with
`--name_out=key=val,a=b:out_directory` or with the generator option flag, `--name_opt`.
See each generator for a full list of their available options.
